# Seattle Coin

A very simple truffle dapp, with a couple modifications for demonstration purposes.

First created for a talk at the Seattle Ethereum Meetup.

First of all, *Seattle Coin* checks for changes to `web3.eth.accounts` in a loop, so that when the user selects a new account, that can be reflected on the dapp immediately, instead of needing to be reloaded.
